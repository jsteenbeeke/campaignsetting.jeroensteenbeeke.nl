Towering over their land-dwelling counterparts, the Belegûr are a breed of colossal, aquatic warhorses native to the ocean world of Eluneia. While outwardly resembling massive, equine beasts, these magnificent creatures possess a number of distinctive aquatic adaptations that set them apart.

Their bodies are encased in shimmering, scale-like plates that range in hue from deep cerulean to vibrant indigo, reflecting the varied tones of the surrounding seas. Beneath their powerful frames, pairs of finned limbs propel the Belegûr through the water with incredible speed and agility. Most striking of all are the broad, membranous gills that line their sturdy necks, allowing them to draw breath from both air and water with equal ease.

Despite their sea-dwelling nature, the Belegûr remain well-suited for land travel, their massive hooves easily traversing rocky shores and sandy beaches. This amphibious mobility, combined with their sheer size and strength, makes the Belegûr a highly sought-after mount among the adventurers, merchants, and naval forces that ply the waters of Eluneia.

Tamed and trained by skilled handlers, these majestic beasts serve as both loyal companions and formidable war steeds, their hooves capable of delivering devastating blows to any who would dare challenge their riders. Whether carrying supplies across treacherous ocean straits or charging into the fray of naval battles, the Belegûr are a true marvel of Eluneia's unique ecology.
