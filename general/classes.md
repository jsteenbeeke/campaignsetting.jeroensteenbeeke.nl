All classes from the core D&D rules are available in this campaign setting, though there are some limitations with regard to race/class combinations, due to backstory reasons. Please refer to the list
below to see what is possible.

## Barbarian

Barbarians can mostly be found among the member races of the [Northborn Coalition](/nations/northborn_coalition), among the [M'to](/races/mto) and the [Warbloods](/races/warbloods), though some [Dvergi](/races/dvergi) Barbarians are known
to exist as well. In some rare cases, [Chadori](/races/chadori) and [Turians](/races/turians) Berserkers have been encountered.

## Bard

Bards exist among all races, though the prevalence of each college depends on the culture:

| Nation | Bard Colleges |
| --- | --- |
| [Kingdom of Adar](/nations/adar_kingdom) | Lore |
| [Chadori Republic](/nations/chadori_republic) | Valor |
| [Coalition of Free Peoples](/nations/coalition_of_free_peoples) | Lore, Valor |
| [Lakhta Hegemony](/nations/lakhta_hegemony) | Lore, Valor |
| [Naderi Empire](/nations/naderi_empire) | Lore |
| [Northborn Alliance](/nations/northborn_alliance) | Valor |
| [Sethai Federation](/nations/sethai_federation) | Lore |

The [Tower Guardians](/nations/tower_guardians) are not known to have Bards, nor any form of entertainment.

## Cleric

Clerics exist among all races and nations.

## Druid

Druids are primarily common in the races of the [Northborn Coalition](/nations/northborn_coalition), though members of races originally from [Danaros](/locations/danaros) who were born in [Eluneia](/locations/eluneia) joining Druidic circles
are not unheard of.

Given the oceanic nature of Eluneia, Druids from the Circle of the Land are often (but not always) Coastal.
