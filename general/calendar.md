Time in Eluneia is measured in a multitude of ways, though many of the basic principles are no different from our world:

- A day has 24 hours, an hour has 60 minutes, a minute has 60 seconds
- A week has 7 days
- A year has 357 days, divided across 12 months, that each has 29 or 30 days

Years are measured in three ways:

- BGC / AGC - Years before and after the [Great Cataclysm](/history/great-cataclysm)
- AGM - Years since the great migration following [the Unbinding](/history/the-unbinding)
- IC - Imperial Calendar, the calendar used by the [Naderi Empire](/nations/naderi_empire)

All recent events are expressed using ACM notation. Events prior to [the Unbinding](/history/the-unbinding) are expressed
using either BGC / AGC (for events in [Eluneia](/locations/eluneia)) or IC (for events in [Danaros](/locations/danaros)).
