Before the [Great Cataclysm](/history/great-cataclysm), the worlds of [Danaros](/locations/danaros) and [Eluneia](/locations/eluneia)
were completely separate from one another, including their respective cosmologies. The cosmology of Eluneia was known as the "great wheel",
whereas the denizens of Danaros spoke of the "tree of worlds". The cataclysm changed all that, merging the multiverses into one,
collapsing many planes, resulting in a multiverse quite unlike the ones that preceded it.

## The Material

This setting's multiverse is unique in that it has not one, but two material planes: the worlds of [Eluneia](/locations/eluneia)
and [Danaros](/locations/danaros). Due to [the Unbinding](/history/the-unbinding), however, the world of Danaros is 
inaccessible for all intents and purposes (anyone traveling there would die almost instantly).

## The near planes

Touching the material planes are the near planes: places that are relatively easy to reach for the inhabitants of Eluneia.

#### The Waterdark

The Waterdark is a place of shadows, mirroring both Eluneia and Danaros in its border regions, but having its own distinct
characteristics once one ventures away from the familiar places. It is said that the Waterdark is situated on the bottom
of Eluneia, and serves as a prison for fallen gods, though this is thought to be a fiction.

**Rules:** The Waterdark functions like the Shadowfell in terms of game mechanics.

#### The Everwoods

The Everwoods are a strange place of wilderness, where the Fae make their home. It is an opposite of Eluneia in many respects, housing
forests where oceans exist in Eluneia, and vast lakes where islands are in Eluneia.

**Rules:** The Everwoods function like the Faewild in terms of game mechanics.

#### The elemental plane of water

The elemental plane of water is the only elemental plane that resembles its state as it was prior to the Great Cataclysm, despite
a significant portion of its water having been shunted to Eluneia.

#### The Ethereal plane

The ethereal plane is a place of incorporeal beings that touches Eluneia, Danaros, the Waterdark, the Feywild and the
elemental plane of Water.

## The outer planes

The near planes touch, at least in some form, the material planes, but there are planes that are not as easy to reach, planes
with their own characteristics that are so unlike the material planes that they can only be reached through extraordinary
means.

#### The Astral Plain

Also known as the "space between", the Astral Plane is a realm of thought, and is often drawn as the space between the planes.

#### Hatarr

Also known as the "burning stormlands", Hatarr is what remains of three of the four elemental planes that used to form the inner circle of Eluneia's cosmology, Hatarr is
a place of air, fire and earth, that is constantly in flux.

#### Oreitha

Oreitha is the result of the four elemental planes of Danaros merging into one, causing a realm of chaos and war, where
elementals constantly war on one another.

#### Roa

Roa, also known as the Dreamlands, is the resting place of heroes. It is a peaceful realm that rarely sees violence.

#### Saugra

Saugra, also known as the great torment, is a prison for those who have caused great suffering. It is a place of punishment,
where armies of devils constantly fie to inflict ever greater torments on those who are sent there.

#### Perpetuum

Perpetuum is the realm of logic, a place of laws, fractal patterns and symmetry.

#### Anathema

Anathema is a place of chaos, a realm that is undefined, and defies any attempt of definition.

## The farthest planes

Beyond the outer planes, where reality itself becomes an abstract concept, are the farthest planes.

#### The Great Void

A place of inertia, death, and negative energy, where nothing lives, and any spark of reality is quickly extinguished. It
is the origin of necrotic energy. Conceptually located below the astral plane.

#### The Fires of Creation

A place of joy, and explosive creation. It is as deadly to living creatures as the Great Void, but for entirely different
reasons: it is like standing right inbetween a dozen Big Bangs simultaneously.

#### Braleath

A place rarely spoken of, and relatively unknown except to older scholars from Danaros: Braleath is the fusion between
a realm of pure good and a realm of pure evil that existed in the cosmology of Danaros prior to the Great Cataclysm. Is
a place of madness, where black is white, up is left, and left is fish.
