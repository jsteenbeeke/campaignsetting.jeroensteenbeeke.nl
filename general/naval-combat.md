The rules for naval combat are largely based on [The Complete guide to Nautical Campaigns](https://www.greatgamemaster.com/dm/product/the-complete-guide-to-nautical-campaigns-pdf/) by [How to be a Great Game Master](https://www.greatgamemaster.com/). This page summarizes the system from a player's perspective, and some details may be abbreviated or simplified. In case of conflict the rules as written in the Complete Guide take precedence.

There are two types of naval combat described in the rules:

- Chase
- Boarding

Boarding is essentially the same as regular combat, with a few additions, so most of this page will focus on Chase Combat.

## Ship statistics

Each ship has its own statistics that are used in various situations including combat. I will briefly list them here as they referenced in various rules, but for the full explanation please refer to the Complete Guide.

| Statistic         | Use                                                                                                                       |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Crew capacity     | Determines the number of crewmembers a ship can have. Stat blocks typically list a starting number and a maximum capacity |
| Crew quality (CQ) | Represents the training and experience of the crew. Used as a modifier in many checks                                     |

| Ship size (SZ)    | A modifier that represents the size of the ship, and is used in various checks to modify the DC                           |
| Travel pace       | The number of miles the ship crosses in a typical day of sailing                                                          |
| Strength          | How much strength a ship has as a result of its movement / propulsion                                                     |
| Dexterity         | The ship's maneuverability                                                                                                |
| Constitution      | Structural soundness of the ship                                                                                          |

| Stores            | Ship resources. Categories include: food, drink, medical, supplies, and various sorts of ammo                             |
| Replacement cost  | The cost to replace a store                                                                                               |
| Salaries          | How much the crew  needs to be paid (total)                                                                               |
| Orders            | How many orders the crew can execute in a single turn                                                                     |

## Chase combat

Chase combat is what happens when a hostile ship comes within range (within 800ft for regular ships, 200ft when underwater) of its quarry. Chase combat can end in a number of ways:
- The distance between ships is reduced to 0ft (either by disabling the quarry or outsailing it), and boarding combat commences
- The distance between ships is increased to more than 800ft, and the chase ends
- The attacking ship is sunk
- The chased ship is sunk 

### Movement

Rather than using a grid with exact positions, naval combat uses a distance tracker with relative positions.

<table class="w-100">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><img class="img-fluid" alt="Surface tracker" src="../surface-tracker.png" /></td>
            <td><img class="img-fluid" alt="Underwater tracker" src="../underwater-tracker.png" /></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="text-center">Surface tracker</td>
            <td class="text-center">Underwater tracker</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

At the end of each turn, the movement speeds of both ships are compared:

{:class="table"}
| Speed difference                                | Movement effect                              |
|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Target ship > Chasing ship (factor 2 or more)   | Target ship moves two positions to the right |
| Target ship > Chasing ship (less than factor 2) | Target ship moves one position to the right  |
| Equal speeds                                    | Target ship remains in position              |
| Chasing ship > Target ship (less than factor 2) | Target ship moves one position to the left   |
| Chasing ship > Target ship(factor 2 or more)    | Target ship moves two positions to the left  |

### Officers

A ship is run by its officers. These officers can be both PCs and NPCs. A ship can have the following officers:

{:class="table"}
| Officer       | Task                                                                                             | Relevant stats         |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Captain       | Leads the ship, manages its operation                                                            | Wisdom, Charisma       |
| First Mate    | Link between crew and captain, ensures smooth operation of ship and responsible for morale       | Wisdom, Charisma       |
| Bosun         | Ensures the ship's structural integrity, layout. Basically a chief engineer                      | Strength               |
| Ship's Mage   | Magical liaison between the ship and the ocean, using magic to get the ship where it needs to be | Intelligence, Charisma | 
| Quartermaster | Ensures the ship is well-supplied; responsible for navigation                                    | Wisdom, Charisma       |
| Surgeon       | Keeps the crew healthy, interrogates prisoners                                                   | Intelligence, Wisdom   | 

### Turns

Ships cannot take actions on their own, so their actions are determined by their crews. As crews can get quite large, the initiative order only tracks any officers a ship may have, and all players.

On each turn, a player can take actions as they normally would, and if they have the role of an officer aboard the ship in question, issue a command (this is generally a free actions, unless stated otherwise). Some of these commands can be issued out of combat as well.

### Orders

Officers can make the following orders for the crew to complete. Not all of these orders are combat-related. 

{:class="table"}
| Order                     | Type     | Issued by                       | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Protect the...   | Assigns crew members to protect officers, adding 10 temp HP per crew member (20 if they are Ship's Guard)                                                                    |

During boarding combat, the PCs focus on enemy officers and vice versa, while the regular crews fight one another. This is done as follows:

- After everyone has taken their turn, both ships make an opposed CQ check. 
- The difference is the number of crew gravely wounded or killed in the losing crew. 
- Ranking officers do not count toward the total
- When all enemy officers are defeated, the enemy ship surrenders
- When the crew of one ship is more than triple the number of crew on the other, the smaller crew surrenders if given a chance
- On an Undead ship, the crew collapses if the ship's Necromancer is slain

In addition to these rules, the following modifiers may apply in crew to crew combat:

- For every 10 additional crew more than the other crew add +1 to the bigger crew’s CQ for the combat.
- For crew that includes ship’s guard increase the CQ by 1 for every 10 ship’s guard.
- For crew fighting in unfamiliar territory, such as underwater, out of water, reduce their CQ by 2.
- Mounted units can join the fight if they’ve been launched. Increase the CQ for that side by +1 per 5 mounted units.
- When the captain is killed or taken prisoner, decrease the CQ for the crew belonging to that captain by 3.
- When a ranking officer dies -1 to the CQ of that crew.
