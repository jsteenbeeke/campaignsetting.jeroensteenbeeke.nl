**Vaedrung** is the [Watcher](../watchers.html) **Goddess of Deceit**. She is the daughter of [Gwydion](../gwydion/), and younger sister of [Ord](../ord/). She has on many occasions foiled the plans of other gods, though not always in obvious ways. This interference has resulted in a long-standing feud with [Felician](/pantheons/fian_chai/felician/), the [Fian Chai](/pantheons/fian_chai/) God of Storms.
