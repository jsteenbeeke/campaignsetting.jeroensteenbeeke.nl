**Felician** is the [Fian Chai](../fian_chai/) **God of Storms**. Among the gods worshipped by the [Sethai](/races/sethai/) he is easily considered the most spirited, and he has little patience. Felician has an ongoing feud with [Vaedrung](/pantheons/watchers/vaedrung/), the [Watcher](/pantheons/watchers/) goddess of Deceit.
