When [the unbinding](/history/the-unbinding) raged across Danaros, many tried to stop it, though ultimately all of them
failed.
In a last ditch effort, the gods of the peoples of Danaros stood together and used their combined power to put a stop to
the
strange affliction.

They failed, and only six of them survived. They are now called the Unscathed, and are worshipped by the survivors of
Danaros.

This pantheon consists of Allindra, Belliom, Drazh, Jao Quan, Riaal and Xax.
