When [the unbinding](/history/the-unbinding) raged across Danaros, many tried to stop it, though ultimately all of them failed. 
In a last ditch effort, the gods of the peoples of Danaros stood together and used their combined power to put a stop to the
strange affliction.

Only six of them survived. They are now called the Unscathed, and are worshipped by the survivors of Danaros.
