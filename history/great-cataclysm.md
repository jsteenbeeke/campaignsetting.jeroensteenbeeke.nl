Over a thousand years prior to the present day, the worlds of [Eluneia](/locations/eluneia) and [Danaros](/locations/danaros) were
completely separate from another, each with their own multiverse. Through some multi-cosmic event that
is still not understood today, the two multiverses collided.

The immediate effect was a disruption of all magic across both worlds, and planar travel becoming completely unreliable. Strange
natural disasters occurred all over Danaros: massive lightning storms, tornadoes, earthquakes, as well as failing harvests and
unexplained livestock deaths.

The effect on Eluneia was much more disruptive. Due to an unstable portal between Eluneia and Danaros' Elemental Plane of Water, the
oceans started to rise rapidly. Thousands died as the people fled the rising water, and many more were killed
in the ensuing chaos, though historians today do not agree to the exact cause if this.

Eluneia suffered massive depopulation and extinctions, and those that survived have only recently recovered
the population levels they had prior to the Cataclysm.
