The War of the Waves was a conflict between the [Sethai Federation](/nations/sethai_federation) and the [Third Wave](/nations/third_wave) that took place between 209 [AR](/general/calendar) and 218 [AR](/general/calendar), resulting in a victory for the Sethai.

## Causes

Following the [Great Cataclysm](/history/great-cataclysm), the world of [Eluneia](/locations/eluneia) was remade. Where once had stood great continents, now stood vast oceans, with survivors scattered across a variety of islands. What civilizations remained had slowly started rebuilding, with the [Sethai Federation](/nations/sethai_federation) being the first nation able to rebuild its navy.

In the mean time, in the depths of the seas south of [Tower Island](/locations/tower_island), a new nation had formed, uniting a multitude of aquatic species not originally native to [Eluneia](/locations/Eluneia) under a single banner.
