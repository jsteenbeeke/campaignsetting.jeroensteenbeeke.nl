A *wakeportal* is a magic item shaped like a crystal tear that allows a ship to shift planes with all its passengers
and cargo. 

It needs to embedded into a ship's wood, and can be activated using a command word followed by the desired
destination, upon which the ship will travel there if the resulting location is suitable for a ship.

After usage, a wakeportal needs 24 hours to recharge.

## Invention

Wakeportals were first created in 1079 AR (1408 IC) by the Fian Orcha of the Sethai Federation on Eluneia. Recognizing the immense potential of their invention, the Fian Orcha quickly shared it with other Sethai castes for exploratory purposes.
The Fian Erigen, known for their mercantile acumen, saw an unprecedented opportunity in this new technology. They swiftly leveraged Wakeportals to establish trade routes with Danaros, forming lucrative partnerships with the Naderi Empire, Lakhta Hegemony, and Turian Kingdom.

## Proliferation

The success of Sethai interplanar trade sparked intense interest from their Danarosian partners:

- **Naderi Espionage**: The Naderi Empire, eager to acquire Wakeportal technology, resorted to theft. They successfully stole a Wakeportal from the Sethai, triggering a significant diplomatic crisis. However, the Naderi only returned the stolen device after they had successfully reverse-engineered and duplicated the technology.
- **Turian Innovation**: Taking a different approach, the Turian Kingdom invested heavily in magical research. Their efforts paid off as they independently developed their own Wakeportal designs, showcasing their magical and technological prowess.
- **Lakhta Acquisition**: The Lakhta Hegemony, not to be left behind, obtained Wakeportal technology by stealing designs from the Turians, further spreading this crucial invention across Danaros.

## Salvation

While initially created for exploration and trade, Wakeportals would later play a crucial and unexpected role in preserving life when Danaros was struck by [the Unbinding](/history/the-unbinding).

In this time of crisis, the widespread adoption of Wakeportal technology proved to be the salvation of the Danarosian people. The existence of numerous Wakeportals across different nations enabled a massive evacuation effort. Thousands of refugees from Danaros were able to flee to the safety of Eluneia, a feat that would have been impossible without this interplanar technology.

Had Wakeportals not been invented and proliferated, only a small handful of powerful mages might have escaped the doomed world, leaving countless lives lost to the Unbinding.
