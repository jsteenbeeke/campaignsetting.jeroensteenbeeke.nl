title: Wakeportal
---
A *wakeportal* is a magic item shaped like a crystal tear that allows a ship to shift planes with all its passengers
and cargo. 

It needs to embedded into a ship's wood, and can be activated using a command word followed by the desired
destination, upon which the ship will travel there if the resulting location is suitable for a ship.

After usage, a wakeportal needs 24 hours to recharge.

## Historical significance

If not for the existence of *wakeportals*, the massive evacuation from [Danaros](/locations/danaros) following [the Unbinding](/history/the-unbinding) could not have 
taken place, and only a handful of people would have made it to Eluneia.
