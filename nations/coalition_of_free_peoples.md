The Coalition of Free Peoples is a republic-like nation that was built by a diverse group of survivors
from [Danaros](/locations/danaros), including the [Companions](/races/companions), [Eriothi](/races/eriothi), 
[Erihain](/races/erihain), [Mordhain](/races/mordhain), [Stoneborn](/races/stoneborn), [Tinkers](/races/tinkers), [Turians](/races/turians).

The Coalition was formed to replace the defunct [Turian](/races/turians) elective monarchy, which saw the demise of most
of its electors in [the Unbinding](/history/the-unbinding), and whose leaders saw that drastic reforms were needed to
address the needs of the diverse group of people now populating their new lands.

The Coalition's capital is the city of [Sunwake](/locations/sunwake)

## Geography

The Coalition spans about a hundred islands, located about a week's travel to the southeast of Tower Island. The largest island and capital is [Sunwake](/locations/sunwake), where the Coalition government, as well as the high temple of Riaal, reside.

## Economy

The islands inhabited by the Coalition are not especially resource rich. While their islands provide enough food to feed the Coalition itself, it limits their growth and does not offer much in the way of exports. Most trade with other nations involves specialized goods and non-magical technology, as the Coalition boasts many innovations unseen in other nations (such as clocks).

## Government

The Coalition of Free Peoples is ruled by a council composed of thirteen members: two from each race (Erihain are not considered a separate race in this regard and can occupy both Turian and Eriothi seats), and one leader called the First Speaker, who is chosen by the other twelve members. In addition to this, a parliament of 37 members (seats divided by estimates of total population of each member races) has legislative power. The laws of the Coalition initially followed established Turian legal practices, though the diversity of the Coalition has caused a significant number of changes to these laws.
 
Judiciary power currently rests with the clergy of [Riaal](/pantheons/the_unscathed) until a more permanent solution can be found, as the old Turian system did not have a division of power. 

The current First Speaker is [Luyim Sandor](/persons/luyim_sandor).

## Military

The Coalition has a sizable navy that follows many of the traditions from the Turian navy that preceeded it, though many other race now take part in it. Having only arrived on Eluneia fairly recently, Coalition military doctrine still follows Turian doctrine, which has resulted in a land army that is much larger than those of nations native to Eluneia, with most Coalition islands having an army contingent present.

## Culture

Coalition culture is a vibrant mixture of the various cultures that preceded its foundation, and while Coalition society is far from perfect, their shared history has created a sense of community among the various member races. Turian culture is slightly predominant, as they are the greatest in number, though not at the expensive of other cultures. Values such as the pursuit of happiness, the betterment of oneself and one's community are widely shared. 

The Coalition is very open to visitors from other lands, provided they share the values of the Coalition. In addition, people in the Coalition are very accepting of those who deviate from what is considered the norm, making the Coalition a refuge for those exiled from other lands.

Each year on the 6th day of Tâderië is Remembrance Day, where the flight from Danaros is remembered, and it is a rather somber occassion, especially for the Stoneborn. 

The 7th day of Tâderië is known as Coalition Day and is one of the most important festivals of the nation, where they celebrate their new home and their shared achievements.
