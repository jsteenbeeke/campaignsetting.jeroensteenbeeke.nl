The Coalition of Free Peoples is a republic-like nation that was built by a diverse group of survivors
from [Danaros](/locations/danaros), including the [Companions](/races/companions), [Eriothi](/races/eriothi), 
[Erihain](/races/erihain), [Mordhain](/races/mordhain), [Stoneborn](/races/stoneborn), [Tinkers](/races/tinkers), [Turians](/races/turians).

The Coalition was formed to replace the defunct [Turian](/races/turians) elective monarchy, which saw the demise of most
of its electors in [the Unbinding](/history/the-unbinding), and whose leaders saw that drastic reforms were needed to
address the needs of the diverse group of people now populating their new lands.

The Coalition's capital is the city of [Sunwake](/locations/sunwake)

## Government

The Coalition of Free Peoples is ruled by a council composed of 11 members: two from each race, and one additional one
chosen by the council by a simple majority. In addition to this, a parliament of 37 members (seats divided by estimates of
 total population of each member races) has legislative power.
The laws of the Coalition initially followed established Turian legal practices, though the diversity of the Coalition has
caused a significant number of changes to these laws.
 
Judiciary power currently rests with the clergy of [Riaal](/pantheons/the_unscathed) until a more permanent solution can
be found, as the old Turian system did not have a division of power.
