The Naderi Empire is the state of the [Naderi](/races/naderi) people. Once a vast continent-spanning empire that few dared
challenge, it has since been reduced to one of the smaller nations, partially due to the [Chadori](/races/chadori) revolt,
but mostly due to an ill-planned and hastily executed evacuation from their ancestral lands in [Danaros](/locations/danaros).

Historically, the Naderi kept many slaves, among them Chadori, [Delvers](/races/delvers) and [Eriothi](/races/eriothi),
though the practice of slave labor has been outlawed after [the Unbinding](/history/the-unbinding).

The Naderi Empire is an enatic constitutional monarchy, with only women allowed to hold positions of power. The Empire is,
as the name suggests, ruled by an empress.
