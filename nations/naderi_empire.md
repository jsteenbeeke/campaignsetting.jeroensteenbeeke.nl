The Naderi Empire is the state of the [Naderi](/races/naderi) people. Once a vast continent-spanning empire that few dared challenge, it has since been reduced to one of the smaller nations, partially due to the [Chadori](/races/chadori) revolt, but mostly due to an ill-planned and hastily executed evacuation from their ancestral lands in [Danaros](/locations/danaros).

Historically, the Naderi kept many slaves, among them Chadori, [Delvers](/races/delvers) and [Eriothi](/races/eriothi), though the practice of slave labor has been outlawed after [the Unbinding](/history/the-unbinding).

## Geography

The Naderi Empire is located west of Tower Island, south of the Chadori Republic and north of the Sethai federation. Several of these islands were colonized prior to the Unbinding and served primarily as trade outposts, including the current capital of Splendor.

The Naderi Empire spans seven larger islands, and about two dozen smaller islands, making the Empire quite small compared to other nations, and only tiny compared to its former size on Danaros.

## Government

The Naderi Empire is an enatic constitutional monarchy, with only women allowed to hold positions of power. The Empire is, as the name suggests, ruled by an empress.

The current empress is [Saphira Lonaria](/persons/saphira_lonaria), who, at 120 years of age, is considered very young for her position, but who came into power due to the previous empress, her aunt **Aphadora Lonaria**, refusing to leave the Imperial Palace in [Danaros](/locations/danaros). The position of empress is hereditary and passed according to [matrilineal primogeniture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primogeniture#Matrilineal_primogeniture).

The empress is aided by the **Midnight Council**, a group of appointed officials representing various aspects of Naderi society (such as the navy). Judicial power rests with the **Sunlit Court**, whose members are appointed by the empress, but only from certain families.

Larger islands other than Splendor are ruled by governors, usually the heads of noble houses. Smaller islands typically fall under the jurisdiction of larger islands, or are directly controlled by the navy.

## Economy

The hasty and ill-planned evacuation from Danaros meant that most surviving Naderi came from coastal cities. While the Naderi reputation for opulence remains, many of their producers of luxury goods lived far inland and died in the Unbinding. They still produce and export luxury items, but not on the scale that gave them their reputation.

Instead, the Naderi have become quite prolific shipbuilders. The Naderi islands are heavily forested, and while they do not directly export lumber themselves, they make heavy use of it. For other materials, the Naderi have become experts in repurposing items and materials.

These changes in economic fortunes have been especially difficult for the surviving nobility, who have struggled to adept to their reduced status.

## Military

Despite the hasty evacuation from Danaros, as well as the fact that quite a few of their ships were stolen by the Chadori in their revolt, the greater part of the Naderi navy, called the **Twilight Armada** was equipped with [Wakeportals](/items/wakeportal) and made it to Eluneia. These ships are well-maintained and their crews still maintain the traditions the navy built back on Danaros. The might of this navy is the primary reason the expansionist Chadori have not overrun the Naderi's new lands.

In contrast the **Imperial Legion** is but a shadow of its former self. Due to many of its battalions being stationed inland during the Unbinding, relatively few of them were evacuated to Danaros. It will likely be centuries before it is on par with the militaries of other nations.

## Culture

Naderi culture is rich and steeped in tradition. Historically they have placed great value in art and luxury, and while the upheaval following their flight from Danaros has put more emphasis on more practical endeavours, artists still hold a place of honor in Naderi society, and many artists from other cultures have made Splendor their home.

Naderi can be distrustful or disdainful to members of other races, owing to their status as former slave owners, though this is more prevalent among older Naderi.

Naderi have many superstitions and peculiar customs. They will refuse to use salt during daylight, they will never sit in a chair with their back facing a door, and they consider it bad luck to completely empty a plate of food.

In addition to the Naderi themselves, the empire has a small population of [Delvers](/races/delvers), with their own customs and traditions. Delvers are full citizens, but never hold any positions of power.
