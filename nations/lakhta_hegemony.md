The [Lakhta](/races/lakhta) hegemony is the government of the Lakhta people and their [Delver](/races/delvers) slaves. It
is an aristocratic nation, with a small group of families electing a leader called the Hegemon.

Originally from [Danaros](/locations/danaros), the Lakhta's ancestral lands were far removed from Khar'muduk, and as such
 were able to evacuate to [Eluneia](/locations/eluneia) in a relatively relaxed pace.
 
Traditionally isolationist, the Lakhta tried to gain greater influence in an attempt to conquer Tower Island in 
[17 NR](/general/calendar), using mass teleportation to sneak a small army to the island. The ensuing battle ended in a
decisive defeat for the Lakhta, their forces obliterated by the [Tower Guardians](/nations/tower_guardians). As a result,
their embassy in [Consensus](/locations/consensus) was torn down, and they no longer take part in the 
[Consensus Council](/organizations/consensus_council).
