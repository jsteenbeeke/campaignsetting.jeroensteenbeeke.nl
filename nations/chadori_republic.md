The [Chadori](/races/chadori) Republic is one of the largest nations in [Eluneia](/locations/eluneia), though its people originally hail from
Danaros, and one of the few nations that bears any resemblance to a modern-day democracy.

The Chadori Republic was formed by escaped slaves from the [Naderi Empire](/nations/naderi_empire) before [the Unbinding](/history/the-unbinding),
and as one of the earliest newcomers among isolationist neighbors, managed to settle a sizable number of islands before
encountering any competition.

The Chadori Republic is expansionistic and militaristic, fueled partly by a desire never to be slaves to anyone again, but
also by several successive population booms. Their expansionism is tempered by their strong sense of honor, and a number
of humbling defeats at the hand of the [Sethai](/nations/sethai_federation).
