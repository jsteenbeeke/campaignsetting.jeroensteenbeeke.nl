The [Chadori](/races/chadori) Republic is one of the largest nations in [Eluneia](/locations/eluneia), though its people originally hail from
Danaros, and one of the few nations that bears any resemblance to a modern-day democracy.

The Chadori Republic was formed by escaped slaves from the [Naderi Empire](/nations/naderi_empire) before [the Unbinding](/history/the-unbinding),
and as one of the earliest newcomers among isolationist neighbors, managed to settle a sizable number of islands before
encountering any competition.

The Chadori Republic is expansionistic and militaristic, fueled partly by a desire never to be slaves to anyone again, but
also by several successive population booms. Their expansionism is tempered by their strong sense of honor, and a number
of humbling defeats at the hand of the [Sethai](/nations/sethai_federation).

## Geography

The Chadori Republic is located about a week's travel to the northwest of [Tower Island](/locations/tower_island), and spans a chain of islands that runs from the southeast to the northwest. The Chadori capitol island of [Liberation](/locations/liberation) is located centrally among this chain.

Each island is part of a district (though many districts span only a single island), and islands are grouped into bailiwicks.

Through a strange twist of fate, the Naderi Empire is the closest nation to Chadori lands, located directly south of the Chadori Republic across the Gulf of Odium.

## Government

The Chadori Republic is headed by the **Council of Voices**, an executive branch consisting of five councilors elected every five years by general elections. Each citizen of the Republic may cast three votes, and the five candidates with the most votes become Councilors.

The legislative branch is known as the **Assembly of the Unchained**, and consists of representatives for the various districts that make up the Republic (most districts consist of a single island), elected once every five years by simple majority vote.

The judicial branch is called the **Scales of Freedom**, and it has three levels of courts: district, bailiwick and national. Judges are elected, though to become a candidate one must pass very stringent tests which are determined at the national level. Once elected, judges generally retain their position for life, though procedures exist to strip corrupt judges from their position.

## Economy

The Chadori are relatively self-sufficient. Their islands are rich in ores, both common (copper, tin, iron) and more exotic (mithril and adamantite), making them the prime suppliers of raw materials to other nations. Chadori islands are are sparsely forested, however, and rely on other nations for lumber.

In the sixty-five years since gaining their freedom, the Chadori have become expert metalworkers and renowned shipbuilders. Chadori jewelry is in high demand among the rich of the various nations.

## Military

The Chadori maintain a sizable fleet known as the **Unbound Fleet**, and have a large standing army both for home defense, and for amphibious assaults. A specialist military force known as the **Chainbreakers** is specialized in the freeing of slaves, and operates largely independently.

## Culture

Chadori place great emphasis on personal freedom, self-reliance and helping one another. Having lived as slaves, their mantra has become "never again", and all Chadori are trained to fight from an early age to ensure they never become slaves again.

The Chadori have great reference for their ancestors. Chadori are shorter lived than humans, and many of those that freed them from slavery have since died of old age. Their names are venerated alongside that of [Jao Quan](/pantheons/the_unscathed/jao_quan/) in Chadori temples.

Despite being former slaves of the [Naderi Empire](/nations/naderi_empire), the Chadori do still hold some of their customs, though they will only acknowledge these customs being Naderi in origin grudgingly, such as never taking a seat with their back facing a door
