The Kingdom of Adar is the second-oldest nation in [Eluneia](/locations/eluneia) (after the [Sethai Federation](/nations/sethai_federation)),
and one of the few that existed prior to the [Great Cataclysm](/history/great-cataclysm).

The Kingdom of Adar is highly isolationist, and the only great nation that declined an invitation to join the [Consensus Council](/organizations/consensus_council), instead
conducting all their trade with the [Fian Erigen](/nations/sethai_federation) as intermediaries.

The Kingdom of Adar has a sizable navy, though it is rarely seen beyond their waters.

## Geography

The Kingdom Adar is located about a day's sail to the southwest of Tower Island, and spans about three dozen islands. The larger islands are hilly and feature steep cliffs, making access difficult except in a few natural bays.

## Government

The Adar are divided into a multitude of clans, though each clan ultimately owes allegiance to one of the five great clans:

- Clan Annys
- Clan Baerath
- Clan Glondil
- Clan Ragdar
- Clan Uthum

The five greater clans form a council called the Ti Ann, where each clan has three representatives. The ruler of the Kingdom is called the Ard Rhi, though this position is more a "first among equals" rather than a monarch in the traditional sense, and is elected from the members of the Ti Ann.

The current Ard Rhi is **[Gorm Glondil](/persons/gorm_glondil)**.

## Economy

The Adar islands are among the most fertile in Eluneia, and their primary exports are agricultural. Many Adar live in small self-sufficient communities run by a single clan, and most of them never leave these communities for most of their lives.

## Military

Each Adar clan has its own militia that is responsible for defending their holdings, their sizes varying depending on the size of each settlement. Most Adar clans revolve around small agricultural communities and are not very large, though when facing larger foes neighboring clans will often come to each other's aid.

While outsiders generally speak of the Adar navy as a single entity, each of the Great Clans has their own navy responsible for guarding their islands, with their own traditions.

## Culture

Many Adar settlements are agricultural in nature, and it is common for these "Inland Adar" to never travel more than a few miles outside of the settlement in which they are born. Intermarriage between clans does happen, and is considered a necessity both to prevent inbreeding and to avoid isolation of communities. Inland Adar are highly suspicious of outsiders, though not hateful.

Adar living in coastal settlements are known as "Coastal Adar", and are generally those involved with either shipbuilding or part of the navy. They too form tight communities, but are somewhat less traditionalist than Inland Adar.

Religion forms an important part of Adar life, and many temples to [Gwydion, Saigra and Kaelash](/pantheons/watchers) can be found throughout their lands, and many families follow a tradition of having their third child join the clergy of one of these gods.

Arcane magic is uncommon among the Adar, though the island of Darkana does feature a school of wizardry, whose members enjoy great respect. Sorcerers are rare and generally unwelcome, and it is not unknown for children exhibiting sorcerous aspects to be banned from Island Adar settlements. These Adar often end up as adventurers beyond Adar lands. Warlocks are treated similarly.

Adar who feel constrained by the strictness of their society often end up adventuring outside of the kingdom. Those with musical talent sometimes end up as bards, a position that enjoys great respect among Inland Adar, seen as those safeguarding history.

## Foreign relations

The Adar have a long history of friendship with the [Sethai Federation](/nations/sethai_federation) that predates the Great Cataclysm. The Sethai are the only people whose ships are allowed entry into Adar harbors, a privilege mostly used by the Fian Erigen. The Sethai maintain an embassy on Darkana.

The Adar have declined to take part in the [Consensus Council](/organizations/consensus_council) and have no formal relations with the other nations.
