The Kingdom of Adar is the second-oldest nation in [Eluneia](/locations/eluneia) (after the [Sethai Federation](/nations/sethai_federation)),
and one of the few that existed prior to the [Great Cataclysm](/history/great-cataclysm).

The Kingdom of Adar is highly isolationist, and the only great nation that declined an invitation to join the [Consensus Council](/organizations/consensus_council), instead
conducting all their trade with the [Fian Erigen](/nations/sethai_federation) as intermediaries.

The Kingdom of Adar has a sizable navy, though it is rarely seen beyond their waters.
