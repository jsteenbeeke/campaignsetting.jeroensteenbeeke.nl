The Northborn Alliance is the over-arching governing body of the [Dvergi](/races/dvergi), [Kalai](/races/kalai), 
[M'to](/races/mto) and [Warbloods](/races/warbloods), representing their various governments, clans and communities.
The Northborn Alliance is a fairly loose alliance, and it is not unknown for factions within the Northborn to be in
conflict with one another. When threatened by outside forces, however, these conflicts are quickly forgotten.

When it comes to their participation in the [Consensus Council](/organizations/consensus_council), the various members
convene on a yearly basis to elect a new representative, who is given a large amount of leeway in how to handle matters
of trade as long as it does not harm any of the member races, and as long as the representative does not tolerate any
incursions into their territories by other nations.
