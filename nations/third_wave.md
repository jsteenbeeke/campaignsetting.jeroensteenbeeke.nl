The Third Wave is the only nation that claims no islands as their own, and consists of a number of aquatic races, though
most of the other races generally only encounter the [Wavetouched](/races/wavetouched) and the [Belehain](/races/belehain).

The Third Wave are governed by a group known only as the Lords of the Deep, but their exact nature is not known to outsiders,
nor to many of their subjects.

The Third Wave once had the goal of conquering all the seas of Eluneia, but following the [War of the Waves](/history/war_of_the_waves)
they have mostly kept to themselves. It is said that they spend a lot of their resources fighting enemies unknown to
surface-dwellers, such as incursions from aquatic planes.
