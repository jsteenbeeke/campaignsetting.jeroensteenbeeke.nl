The Third Wave is the only nation that claims no islands as their own, and consists of a number of aquatic races, though
most of the other races generally only encounter the [Wavetouched](/races/wavetouched) and the [Belehain](/races/belehain).

The Third Wave are governed by a group known only as the Lord of the Deep, but their exact nature is not known to outsiders,
nor to many of their subjects.
