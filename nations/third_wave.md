The Third Wave is the only nation that claims no islands as their own, and consists of a number of aquatic races, though
most of the other races generally only encounter the [Wavetouched](/races/wavetouched) and the [Belehain](/races/belehain).

The Third Wave are governed by a group known only as the Lords of the Deep, but their exact nature is not known to outsiders,
nor to many of their subjects.

The Third Wave once had the goal of conquering all the seas of Eluneia, but following the [War of the Waves](/history/war_of_the_waves)
they have mostly kept to themselves. It is said that they spend a lot of their resources fighting enemies unknown to
surface-dwellers, such as incursions from aquatic planes.

## Geography
The Third Wave claims no surface territory, instead establishing their dominion in the depths of Eluneia's oceans. Their settlements span three distinct ecological zones, each serving unique purposes in their society.

The Twilight Belt, ranging from 200 to 1000 meters below the surface, serves as the primary residential zone for most Wavetouched and Belehain citizens. Their cities are architectural marvels carved into continental shelves and underwater cliff faces, illuminated by carefully cultivated bioluminescent flora. The inhabitants navigate their realm through an intricate network of current paths, maintained by constant magical manipulation to serve as underwater highways between settlements.

Deeper still lies the Midnight Realm, spanning depths from 1000 to 4000 meters. This zone houses most government facilities and military installations, built around hydrothermal vents that provide both power and heat. Large sections of this realm are designated as restricted "research facilities," though few know their true purpose. Deep-sea merchants occasionally report mysterious lights pulsing in these depths, their source unknown.

The Abyssal Plain, extending beyond 4000 meters, remains largely unexplored by common citizens. This mysterious realm is the subject of countless rumors, with tales speaking of ancient ruins and secret installations. Many believe this zone houses the true seats of power for the Lords of the Deep. Sailors and deep-dwelling citizens sometimes report strange songs and vibrations emanating from these lightless depths, though such reports are often dismissed by authorities.


## Government

The Third Wave operates under what appears to be an oligarchic bureaucracy, though the true nature of power is deliberately obscured. At its head sit the Lords of the Deep, a mysterious ruling council whose members are never seen in public. Their will is conveyed through the Tide Speakers, public-facing administrators who interact with the general population. Below them, Current Keepers manage individual settlements, while Depth Wardens maintain law and order throughout the nation's territory.

The bureaucracy places heavy emphasis on record-keeping and documentation, with every citizen's movements and activities carefully tracked through an elaborate system of permits and access zones. Authority flows through multiple layers of governance whose relationships often seem intentionally unclear. Citizens frequently find themselves relocated between settlements without explanation, contributing to a sense of impermanence and fluid identity within the society.


## Economy

The Third Wave operates a mixed economy with strong central planning elements, leveraging their unique position as masters of the deep. Their economy centers around deep-sea mining and mineral extraction, alongside the cultivation of unique deep-water organisms. They've developed considerable expertise in producing pressure-resistant materials and equipment, and maintain a lucrative trade in ancient artifacts and what they call "recovered technologies."
Their trade relations with surface nations are carefully controlled. Trading posts are maintained at neutral depths accessible to surface vessels, where they exchange rare minerals, deep-sea materials, and preserved aquatic specimens for surface-crafted goods, magical items, and most importantly, information. All commerce is strictly regulated and monitored, with detailed records kept of every transaction.

## Military

The Third Wave maintains a formidable military force whose true capabilities remain largely unknown to outsiders. Their standard forces, the Wave Guards, patrol the borders of their territory, while the elite Storm Callers provide magical support and specialized operations. The mysterious Deep Hunters handle covert operations, and the enigmatic Trench Wardens patrol the deepest reaches of their domain.
Their military doctrine emphasizes magical warfare, particularly the use of sonic weapons and pressure manipulation. They excel at ambush tactics, using their intimate knowledge of the underwater environment to their advantage. Their territory is defended by extensive underwater fortifications, many of which are hidden from view by natural features or magical means.

## Culture

Third Wave culture exists as a unique blend of pragmatism and mystery, shaped by both their environment and their history. Their society operates on an allegedly merit-based advancement system, though the criteria for advancement often seem arbitrary to outsiders. They place strong emphasis on collective responsibility, with distinct social separation between those dwelling at different depths.

Communication within their society extends beyond mere words, incorporating complex systems of gestures and vibrations that carry subtle meanings. Their artists primarily work with pressure and sound, creating works that surface dwellers often find incomprehensible or disturbing.

The society maintains an obsessive approach to history and record-keeping, with regular "commemoration" ceremonies of the Great Cataclysm that brought them to this world. Their spiritual beliefs, while not organized into an official state religion, center around what they call the "Deep Mysteries." Water-based divination is widely practiced, and citizens commonly believe in deep-sea omens and superstitions.
