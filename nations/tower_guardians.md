The Tower Guardians appear as tall suits of moving armor, and guard the tower that houses the [Eye of Atan](). Not much is known about them, and the only place they are known to inhabit is [Tower Island](/locations/tower-island), though the Sethai claim they control a vast empire somewhere north-east of the [Sethai Federation](/nations/sethai-federation)
