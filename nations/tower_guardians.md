The Tower Guardians appear as tall suits of moving armor, and guard the tower that houses the [Eye of Atan](/items/eye_of_atan). 
Not much is known about them, and the only place they are known to inhabit is [Tower Island](/locations/tower-island), 
though the [Sethai](/races/sethai) claim they control a vast empire somewhere north-west of the [Sethai Federation](/nations/sethai-federation),
 though no expeditions to those waters has ever returned.

The Tower Guardians have a seat in the [Consensus Council](/organizations/consensus_council), but always abstain from voting.
