The Tower Guardians appear as tall suits of moving armor, and guard the tower that houses the [Eye of Atan](/items/eye_of_atan). 
Not much is known about them, and the only place they are known to inhabit is [Tower Island](/locations/tower-island), 
though the [Sethai](/races/sethai) claim they control a vast empire somewhere north-west of the [Sethai Federation](/nations/sethai-federation),
 though no expeditions to those waters has ever returned.

There are no known records among the races of [Eluneia](/locations/eluneia) of the Tower Guardians prior to the [Great Cataclysm](/history/great-cataclysm),
and no records of them engaging in any military encounters.
The one exception is when the [Lakhta Hegemony](/nations/lakhta_hegemony) attempted to take control of the Tower of Atan with
a small batallion and several higher level wizards. The Lakhta forces were annihilated, and the Tower Guardians proceeded to
tear down the Lakhta embassy.

The Tower Guardians have a seat in the [Consensus Council](/organizations/consensus_council), but always abstain from voting.
