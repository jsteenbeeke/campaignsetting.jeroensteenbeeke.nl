The Sethai Federation is the nation that governs the [Sethai](/races/sethai) people, and is the oldest known nation on [Eluneia](/locations/eluneia), its existence
predating [the Great Cataclysm](/history/great-cataclysm). The Sethai are generally not considered aggressive, though they are both isolationist and fiercely territorial, and their navy
is considered without equal among the other nations. Outsiders are generally not welcome in the Sethai's islands, except in a small number of ports, such as [Eyalla](/locations/eyalla).

Each member of the Sethai Federation belongs to one of three castes:

- Fian Erigen - The trader's caste
- Fian Orcha - The spirit caste
- Fian Crait - The war caste

Each caste has its own method of governance; the nation as a whole is governed by a body called the Fian Awin, though it is unknown were they are based or who its members are.
