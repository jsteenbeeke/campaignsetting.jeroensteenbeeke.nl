The Sethai Federation is the nation that governs the [Sethai](/races/sethai) people, and is the oldest known nation on [Eluneia](/locations/eluneia), its existence predating [the Great Cataclysm](/history/great-cataclysm). The Sethai are generally not considered aggressive, though they are both isolationist and fiercely territorial, and their navy is considered without equal among the other nations. Outsiders are generally not welcome in the Sethai's islands, except in a small number of ports, such as [Eyalla](/locations/eyalla).

Each member of the Sethai Federation belongs to one of three castes:

- Fian Erigen - The trader's caste
- Fian Orcha - The spirit caste
- Fian Crait - The war caste

Each caste has its own method of governance; the nation as a whole is governed by a body called the Fian Awin, though it is unknown were they are based or who its members are.

## Geography

The Sethai Federation is spread across a hundred or so islands, with three larger islands located centrally in their territory. Most Sethai live in the central islands, and the outer islands are sparsely populated.

## Government

The Sethai Federation is ruled by the Fian Awin, a council with representatives of each of the three castes. The members of the Fian Awin are not known to the general public. The Fian Awin
have ultimate authority even over caste matters, able to overrule the leadership of each caste.

In addition to the Fian Awin, the three castes have their own method of governing.

### Fian Erigen - The trader's caste

The Fian Erigen are a [Plutocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutocracy) in terms of governance, where leaders are selected based on their wealth and prowess as traders. Upon death, an individual's wealth is equally divided among the caste to grant all a chance to acquire wealth of their own, primarily to prevent wealth being hoarded among powerful families. This system is not perfect, though the Fian Erigen generally frown upon those who coast solely on the success of their parents, and often do not grant them positions of leadership.

The Fian Erigen's ruling council is called the Fi Erig, and it's current chairman is [Dannen Telar](/persons/dannen_telar).

### Fian Orcha - The spirit caste

The Fian Orcha are organized as a council republic (the closest real-life analog is [Soviet Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_democracy)), where there are many layers of councils the elect representatives for the next layer, with an overarching council called the Fi Taiva that rules the whole caste.

The current chairman of the Fi Taiva is [Dran Raal](/persons/dran_raal).

### Fian Crait - The war caste

The Fian Crait are autocratic, following a strict military chain of command. All members of the caste follow combat training from an early age, though not all of them serve as soldiers (weaponsmiths and shipbuilders are also common among the Fian Crait, and have their own chain of command, though these are more akin to guilds than military).

The leader of the Fian Crait is called the Cin Faena, and this position is currently held by [Isin Ronnoc](/persons/isin_ronnoc). Positions are held for life.

#### Crait Ari

If a leader within the Fian Crait is deemed incompetent by more than half of his direct subordinates, one of these subordinates can call a *Crait Ari*, which is a trial by combat. The survivor assumes the position that was challenged.

## Economy

Despite the caste system, the Sethai economy is basically a market economy.

The Sethai primarily export items of a magical nature, many of them produced by the Fian Orcha (though the Fian Crait are experts in the production of magical weapons, their export is limited). Their primary imports are food and raw materials, which they only produce in a limited quantity.

## Military

The Fian Crait _are_ the military, and have a highly advanced navy that has many weapons and innovations unavailable to other nations. Their army is more or less on par with those of other nations, making them more dangerous at sea than on land. The Sethai are not overly expansionistic (the status quo being more than sufficient for their continued growth for the foreseeable future).

## Culture

Sethai society is heavily segregated along caste lines, and the various castes often live in separate settlements. Sethai belong to the same caste as their parents, and Sethai born to parents of different castes are exiled, along with their parents, never allowed to set foot on Sethai lands again.
Despite the heavy segregation, Sethai society is generally harmonious. There is great respect among the castes, and their relation is considered to be symbiotic despite their segregation.

### Fian Erigen

Fian Erigen are the most outward-focused of the Sethai, and their society reflects this. While their lives are often heavily focused on the acquisition of wealth, their society most resembles that of other nations, and is the least ritualized of all Sethai.

Wealth and acumen are their measures of worth, with families vying to outdo one another in displays of prosperity and clever dealings. The Erigen's lives revolve around the ebb and flow of supply and demand, their homes adorned with exotic wares from distant shores. They are a caste of opportunity seekers, always alert for the next lucrative venture or untapped resource.

### Fian Orcha

Fian Orcha are highly inward-focused, and the least likely among the Sethai to venture outside their ancestral lands. Many of their day-to-day activities are ritualized in some form or other. The Fian Orcha dedicate their lives to unraveling the mysteries of magic and maintaining the delicate balance between the mortal and spiritual realms. Their temples, adorned with intricate runes and ethereal crystals, serve as bastions of learning and contemplation. The Orcha's influence permeates every aspect of Sethai life, from blessing newborns to guiding the departed. They are the guardians of ancient rituals, their incantations weaving protective wards around Sethai islands. Their prophetic visions and counsel shape the federation's path, while their healers tend to both body and soul. The Orcha view themselves as the conscience of their people, striving to preserve the harmony between progress and tradition in an ever-changing world.

### Fian Erigen

The Fian Crait embody the martial spirit of the Sethai, their very presence a testament to strength and discipline. These proud warriors are more than mere soldiers; they are the living shields of their people, their bodies honed into weapons through rigorous training and magical enhancement. Honor and duty are the cornerstones of Fian Crait philosophy, with elaborate codes of conduct governing their every action. Their fortresses, carved into cliffsides or perched atop the highest peaks, stand as impregnable bastions against any threat. In times of peace, the Fian Crait serve as guardians of order, their patrols a common sight in Sethai waters. Their martial prowess is matched only by their strategic minds, with Fian Crait tacticians revered for their ability to outmaneuver any foe. While they prepare ceaselessly for war, the Crait take pride in maintaining peace through strength, their very existence a deterrent to those who might threaten the Sethai way of life.
