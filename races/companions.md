Nobody quite knows when the Companions first started living amont the other races, but with the loss of many historical
sources due to [the Unbinding](/history/the-unbinding) it is unlikely the truth will ever be found out. What is known,
is that for as long as anybody can remember, the Companions have been living among the Turians, a relationship most members of
either race consider symbiotic.

Companions stand half as tall as humans, and while they generally form their own communities within existing cities, they
have never held lands they call their own.

## Religion

Companions typically worship [Belliom](/pantheons/the_unscathed).

## Rules

Companions follow the same rules as **Halflings** as stated in the Player's Handbook, page 26 and 28, with the following change:

- Companions speak [Ruaini](/general/languages) (instead of Halfling) and [Turian](/general/languages) (instead of Common)
- Companions gain the [Child of Danaros](/rules/child_of_danaros) trait
