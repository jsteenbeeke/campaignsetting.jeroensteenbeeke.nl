Delvers are a lean and dark-skinned folk that is not well-known outside of the [Lakhta Hegemony](/races/delvers), where they live as slaves
to the [Lakhta](/races/lakhta). While it is suspected they are related to the [Tinkers](/races/tinkers) in some way, there
is no way to verify this, as they have been slaves longer than there are written records.

## Religion

Delvers, in public, appear to worship [Xax](/pantheons/the_unscathed) like their [Lakhta](/races/lakhta) overlords, though
many worship [Allindra](/pantheons/the_unscathed) in secret.

## Rules

Delvers follow the same rules as **Deep Gnomes** as stated in the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, page 115, with the following addition:

- Delvers speak [Delver](/general/languages) (instead of Undercommon) and [Lakhta](/general/languages)
- Delvers do not speak Gnomish
- Delvers gain the [Child of Danaros](/rules/child_of_danaros) trait
