## Religion

Delvers, in public, appear to worship [Xax](/pantheons/the_unscathed) like their [Lakhta](/races/lakhta) overlords, though
many worship [Allindra](/pantheons/the_unscathed) in secret.

## Rules

Delvers follow the same rules as **Deep Gnomes** as stated in the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, page 115, with the following addition:

- Delvers speak [Delver](/general/languages) (instead of Undercommon) and [Lakhta](/general/languages)
- Delvers do not speak Gnomish
- Delvers gain the [Child of Danaros](/rules/child_of_danaros) trait
