Delvers are a lean and dark-skinned folk that are primarily found in the [Lakhta Hegemony](/races/delvers), where they live as slaves to the [Lakhta](/races/lakhta), though some live in the [Naderi Empire](/nations/naderi_empire). While it is suspected they are related to the [Tinkers](/races/tinkers) in some way, there is no way to verify this.

## Religion

Delvers generally worship [Allindra](/pantheons/the_unscathed), though those living as slaves in the Lakhta Hegemony will go through the motions of paying homage to [Xax](/pantheons/the_unscathed) for the benefit of their Lakhta overlords.

## Rules

Delvers follow the same rules as **Deep Gnomes** as stated in the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, page 115, with the following addition:

- Delvers speak [Delver](/general/languages) (instead of Undercommon) and either [Lakhta](/general/languages) or [High Imperial](/general/languages)
- Delvers do not speak Gnomish
- Delvers gain the [Child of Danaros](/rules/child_of_danaros) trait
