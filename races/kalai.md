Kalai are a short, kindly looking, and seemingly shy folk. They do not often venture beyond their lands, and tend to stay
in their forest homes. They resemble [Tinkers](/races/tinkers) to some degree, but they have vastly different customs,
and don't often mix. Whether or not they have any common ancestry is unknown, but doubtful, considering Kalai are native
to Eluneia.

Kalai are masters of illusion, and have a history of keeping to themselves. They joined the [Northborn Alliance](/nations/northborn_alliance)
primarily for purposes of protection from goblin threats from the north. They were already on friendly terms with the M'to,
and gladly accepted their offer of a military alliance, to which they mostly contribute resources and food.

## Religion

Kalai typically worship [Gwydion, Dealas or Kaelash](/pantheons/watchers).

## Rules

Kalai follow the same rules as the **Forest Gnomes** as stated in the Player's Handbook, page 37, with the following changes:

- Kalai speak [Kalai](/general/languages) (instead of Gnomish), [Turian](/general/languages) (instead of Common), and one of the following:
  - [Dvergi](/general/languages)
  - [Griash](/general/languages)
  - [M'to](/general/languages)
- Kalai gain the [Child of Eluneia](/rules/child_of_eluneia) trait
