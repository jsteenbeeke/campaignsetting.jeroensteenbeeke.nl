No one knows the true origin of the Mordhain, though it is agreed by scholars that at some point in their past, the humans of
the nation of Mordha on [Danaros](/locations/danaros) made a pact with an greater fiend, resulting in their altered visage.

Over the centuries, their nation was steadily conquered by the superior militaries of the Naderi and the Lakhta, until
they became a protectorate of the Turians, who secured their borders.

When [the Unbinding](/history/the-unbinding) came, the Turian navy evacuated the Mordhain, and they now form part of the
[Coalition of Free Peoples](/nations/coalition_of_free_peoples).

## Religion

Mordhain come from many backgrounds, and have been known to follow [Allindra, Belliom and Xax](/pantheons/the_unscathed),
though it is not unheard of to find them worshipping other gods.

## Rules

Mordhain follow the same rules as **Tieflings** as stated in the Player's Handbook, page 42 and 43, with the following changes:

- Mordhain speak [Turian](/general/languages) (instead of Common) and [Infernal](/general/languages)
- Mordhain gain the [Child of Danaros](/rules/child_of_danaros) trait
