## Religion

Eriothi typically worship [Drazh](/pantheons/the_unscathed).

## Rules

Tinkers follow the same rules as **Rock Gnomes** as stated in the Player's Handbook, page 38, with the following changes:

- Tinkers speak [Tharukan](/general/languages) (instead of Gnomish) and [Danaran](/general/languages) (instead of Common):
- Tinkers gain the [Child of Danaros](/rules/child_of_danaros) trait
