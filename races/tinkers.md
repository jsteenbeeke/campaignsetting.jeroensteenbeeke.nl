Tinkers are a short folk, taller than [Companions](/races/companions) but shorter than [Stoneborn](/races/stoneborn), though
no one would mistake them for such. They have a passing resemblance to the [Kalai](/races/kalai), but other than physical
similarities, the two races have nothing in common.
 
Tinkers are travelers, first and foremost. Even on [Danaros](/locations/danaros), they did not have any permanent settlements,
instead living primarily in traveling carts, a way of life still practiced by some on the islands of the [Coalition of Free Peoples](/nations/coalition_of_free_peoples). 
Most of the survivors live on ships now, and they travel the waters of [Eluneia](/locations/eluneia) in small fleets, going
from port to port.

Tinkers are also known for their inventiveness, a trait admired among many.

## Religion

Tinkers typically worship [Drazh](/pantheons/the_unscathed).

## Rules

Tinkers follow the same rules as **Rock Gnomes** as stated in the Player's Handbook, page 38, with the following changes:

- Tinkers speak [Tharukan](/general/languages) (instead of Gnomish) and [Turian](/general/languages) (instead of Common):
- Tinkers gain the [Child of Danaros](/rules/child_of_danaros) trait
