Tinkers are a short folk, taller than [Companions](/races/companions) but shorter than [Stoneborn](/races/stoneborn), though
no one would mistake them for such. They have a passing resemblance to the [Kalai](/races/kalai), but other than physical
similarities, the two races have nothing in common.
 
Tinkers love to travel, and they could often be found traveling with groups of [Tidedancers](/races/tidedancers), a practice that is still common now they live on Eluneia, though the majority of Tinkers live in settlements. 

Tinkers are also known for their inventiveness, a trait admired among many.

## Religion

Tinkers typically worship [Drazh](/pantheons/the_unscathed).

## Rules

Tinkers follow the same rules as **Rock Gnomes** as stated in the Player's Handbook, page 38, with the following changes:

- Tinkers speak [Tharukan](/general/languages) (instead of Gnomish) and [Turian](/general/languages) (instead of Common):
- Tinkers gain the [Child of Danaros](/rules/child_of_danaros) trait
