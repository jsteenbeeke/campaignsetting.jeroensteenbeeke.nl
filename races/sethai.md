The Sethai are an ancient people native to Eluneia, whose [nation](/nations/sethai_federation) predates the [Great Cataclysm](/history/great-cataclysm)
by a significant margin. Despite their age, their population levels have only restored to pre-cataclysm levels in recent years.

The Sethai are masters of magic, and the creation of magical artifacts. Their society is complex, being divided into three castes and
ruled by an invisible ruling class. It is also highly isolationist, and few outsiders are welcome. This however, does not
stop curious Sethai from becoming adventurers.

Physically, the Sethai resemble [Eriothi](/races/eriothi), though they have skin that is even paler than the [Lakhta](/races/lakhta), are completely hairless,
and have black spots that originate from their necks, follow their jaw to their temples, and form a crown around the cranium. 

## Religion

The Sethai have [their own pantheon](/pantheons/fian_chai), their caste generally determining who they worship.

## Rules

Sethai follow the same rules as the **High Elves** as stated in the Player's Handbook, page 23 to 24, with the following changes:

- Sethai speak [the Gray Speech](/general/languages) (instead of Elvish) and [Turian](/general/languages) (instead of Common)
- Sethai gain the [Child of Eluneia](/rules/child_of_eluneia) trait
