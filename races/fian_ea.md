{% include raceBlock.html name="Fian Ea" origin="Eluneia" home="Talias" nation="Sethai Federation" nationlink="/nations/sethai_federation" %}

To the untrained eye, the Fian Ea look just like [Sethai](/races/sethai): tall, hairless, spots marking what would in other
 species be their hairlines. Upon closer examination, however, even a casual observer would notice the slightly bluish 
 hue of their skins, and after a while it becomes hard to ignore the gills and webbed fingers.
 
The Fian Ea were created eight hundred years ago as part of the [War of the waves](/history/war_of_the_waves).

## Religion

The Fian Ea generally worship [Felician](/pantheons/fian_chai).

## Rules

Fian Ea follow the same rules as the **Sea Elves** as stated on page 62 of Mordankainen's Tome of Foes, with the following changes:

- Fian Ea speak [the Gray Speech](/general/languages) (instead of Aquan). Their dialect is typically hard to understand for other speakers of the language. 
  In addition, Fian Ea who choose to become adventurers also know [Turian](/general/languages).
- Fian Ea gain the [Child of Eluneia](/rules/child_of_eluneia) trait
- Fian Ea gain the following Flaw: "I cannot harm a member of the [Fian Awin](/nations/sethai_federation), and must obey their commands"
