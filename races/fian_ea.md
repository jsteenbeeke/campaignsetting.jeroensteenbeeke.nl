To the untrained eye, the Fian Ea look just like [Sethai](/races/sethai): tall, hairless, spots marking what would in other
 species be their hairlines. Upon closer examination, however, even a casual observer would notice the slightly bluish 
 hue of their skins, and after a while it becomes hard to ignore the gills and webbed fingers.
 
The Fian Ea were created eight hundred years ago as part of the [War of the waves](/history/war_of_the_waves).

## Rules

Fian Ea follow the same rules as the **Sea Elves** as stated in Mordankainen's Tome of Foes:

- Fian Ea gain the [Child of Eluneia](/rules/child_of_eluneia) trait
- Fian Ea gain the following Flaw: "I cannot harm a member of the [Fian Awin](/nations/sethai_federation), and must obey their commands"
