Erihain are children born out of unions between [Eriothi](/races/eriothi) and either [Turians](/races/turians) or [Lakhta](/races/lakhta), though the latter is
far less common.

## Rules

Erihain follow the same rules as **Half Elves** as stated in the Player's Handbook, page 39 and 40, with the following change:

- Erihain speak [Eriothi](/general/languages) (instead of Elvish) and one of the following languages (instead of Common):
  - [Lakhta](/general/languages)
  - [Turian](/general/languages)
- Erihain gain the [Child of Danaros](/rules/child_of_danaros) trait
