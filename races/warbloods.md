No one knows the exact origins of the Warbloods, though it is widely accepted that what once were two people is now one. It is said
that Warbloods have both Orcish and human ancestors, though with the color of their skin ranging from olive and bronze to greenish
and blue, it is almost certain that their human ancestors were not [M'to](/races/mto).

Warbloods are a passionate people, and outsiders visiting their settlements are often amazed by the casual use of violence among
them. It is not unusual to find at least two Warbloods fighting at any given point during the day, though this behavior
is not gender-specific. Warblood females are at least as aggressive as males.

Despite their name and violent nature. Warbloods generally have good relations with their neighbors, though they fight among
themselves, and with the M'to, rather frequently. Outside of [their own alliance](/nations/northborn_alliance), they get
along with the [Chadori](/races/chadori) especially well, and have developed a special appreciation for the [Tinkers](/races/tinkers).

## Religion

Warbloods typically worship [Gwydion, Dealas or Vaedrung](/pantheons/watchers).

## Rules

Warbloods follow the same rules as **Half-Orcs** as defined on pages 40 and 41 of the Player's Handbook, with the following changes:

- Kalai speak [Griash](/general/languages) (instead of Orcish), [Turian](/general/languages) (instead of Common), and one of the following:
  - [Dvergi](/general/languages)
  - [Kalai](/general/languages)
  - [M'to](/general/languages)
 - Warbloods gain the [Child of Eluneia](/rules/child_of_eluneia) trait
