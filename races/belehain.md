{% include raceBlock.html name="Belehain" origin="Eluneia" nation="The Third Wave" nationlink="/nations/third_wave" %}

The Belehain are an aquatic race who make up the bulk of the population of the [Third Wave](/nations/third_wave). Originally
evolving in an elemental water plain, the [Great Cataclysm](/history/great-cataclysm) caused a massive migration of the
Belehain to [Eluneia](/locations/eluneia).

Belehain generally don't mix well with races that are not part of the [Third Wave](/nations/third_wave), though those Belehain
that adopt adventuring lifestyles are exceptions.

## Religion

Belehain tend to be atheistic, considering the [Lord of the Deep](/nations/third_wave) more tangible than any god, though some of them worship [Ord](/pantheons/watchers).

## Rules

Belehain follow the same rules as **Tritons** as defined on pages 115 to 118 of Volo's Guide to Monsters, with the following addition:

- Belehain speak [Wavesong](/general/languages) (instead of Primordial) and [Turian](/general/languages) (instead of Common)
- Belehain gain the [Child of Eluneia](/rules/child_of_eluneia) trait
