When the [Great Cataclysm](/history/great-cataclysm) drowned the world of [Eluneia](/locations/eluneia), its effects were
not limited to simple flooding. The cataclysm was accompanied by a huge influx of elemental energy, which transformed the denizens of
a human civilization close to the breach into creatures of elemental water.

The Wavetouched still live in the ruins of their old civilization, which they now share with the [Belehain](/races/belehain) and
a number of other aquatic species.

## Religion

Wavetouched tend to be atheistic, considering the [Lord of the Deep](/nations/third_wave) more tangible than any god, though some of them worship [Ord](/pantheons/watchers).

## Rules

Wavetouched follow the same rules as **Water Genasi** as defined on pages 7 to 10 of the Elemental Evil Player's Guide, with the following addition:

- Wavetouched speak [Wavesong](/general/languages) (instead of Primordial) and [Turian](/general/languages) (instead of Common)
- Wavetouched gain the [Child of Eluneia](/rules/child_of_eluneia) trait
