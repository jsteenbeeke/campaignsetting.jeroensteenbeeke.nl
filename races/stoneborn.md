## Religion

Stoneborn typically worship [Riaal](/pantheons/the_unscathed).

## Rules

Stoneborn follow the same rules as **Mountain Dwarves** as stated in the Player's Handbook, page 20, with the following changes:

- Stoneborn speak [Tharukan](/general/languages) (instead of Dwarvish) and [Turian](/general/languages) (instead of Common)
- Any Stoneborn over the age of 60 suffers from something called the Great Longing,
  which manifests itself as a flaw: "I long for a home I can never return to"
- Stoneborn gain the [Child of Danaros](/rules/child_of_danaros) trait
