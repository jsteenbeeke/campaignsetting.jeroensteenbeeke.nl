The Stoneborn are a dying race, with less than a thousand of their people having survived [the Unbinding](/history/the-unbinding), due
to the afflication starting in one of their largest settlements and spreading to most of their ancestral lands before its
urgency was understood.

Stoneborn are short and stout, and sometimes mistaken for [Adar](/races/adar) by people native to [Eluneia](/locations/eluneia),
a comparison neither the Adar nor the Stoneborn appreciate (the two species are not compatible).

Both male and female Stoneborn have beards. Facial hair generally starts growing during puberty, as with humans.

## Religion

Stoneborn typically worship [Riaal](/pantheons/the_unscathed).

## Rules

Stoneborn follow the same rules as **Mountain Dwarves** as stated in the Player's Handbook, page 20, with the following changes:

- Stoneborn speak [Tharukan](/general/languages) (instead of Dwarvish) and [Turian](/general/languages) (instead of Common)
- Any Stoneborn over the age of 60 suffers from something called the Great Longing,
  which manifests itself as a flaw: "I long for a home I can never return to"
- Stoneborn gain the [Child of Danaros](/rules/child_of_danaros) trait
