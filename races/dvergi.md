The Dvergi are a race of stout and dark-skinned folk that evolved underground, but relocated to the surface after many of
their settlements got flooded during the [Great Cataclysm](/history/great-cataclysm).

Dvergi are traditionalists, though they are known among other races primarily for their idiosyncrasy, their capacity for self-mockery and their
strange sense of humor.

While their appearance is somewhat similar to that of the [Adar](/races/adar) and the [Stoneborn](/races/stoneborn), they
are not related (though quite a few Dvergi jokes and curses involve Adar breeding with Stoneborn).

Male Dvergi tend to have long hair and long beards, which can have a variety of colors. Female Dvergi have no hair at all.

## Religion

Dvergi typically worship [Gwydion or Vaedrung](/pantheons/watchers), considering them to be the only true gods, and mortal
enemies of each other.

## Rules

Dvergi follow the same rules as the **Duergar variant** [as defined on the D&D 5e Wiki](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Duergar,_Variant_(5e_Subrace)), with the following changes:

- Dvergi do not have _Sunlight Sensitivity_

  - [Griash](/general/languages)
  - [Kalai](/general/languages)
  - [M'to](/general/languages)
- Dvergi gain the [Child of Eluneia](/rules/child_of_eluneia) trait
