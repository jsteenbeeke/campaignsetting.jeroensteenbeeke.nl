The Dvergi are a race of small and dark-skinned folk that evolved underground, but relocated to the surface after many
of
their settlements got flooded during the [Great Cataclysm](/history/great-cataclysm).

Dvergi are traditionalists, though they are known among other races primarily for their idiosyncrasy, their capacity for
self-mockery and their
strange sense of humor.

Dvergi are about as tall as [Adar](./adar) and [Stoneborn](./stoneborn) though they are somewhat less stout and have
pointy ears. Dvergi
generally have gray or white hair, and tend to keep it short. Facial hair is limited to males, and they favor short
beards.

## Religion

Dvergi typically worship [Gwydion or Vaedrung](/pantheons/watchers), considering them to be the only true gods, and
mortal
enemies of each other.
