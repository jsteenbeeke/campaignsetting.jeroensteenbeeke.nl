The Adar, or "people of the hills", as they call themselves, are an ancient people, and the second most populous of the races
that survived the [Great Cataclysm](/history/great-cataclysm). People from Danaros often mistake them for [Stoneborn](/races/stoneborn)—
a comparison neither the Adar nor the Stoneborn appreciate—even though the two species are not biologically compatible.

## Rules

Adar follow the same rules as **Hill Dwarves** as stated in the Player's Handbook, page 20, with the following changes:

- Adar speak [Adar](/general/languages) (in place of Dwarvish), and [Turian](/general/languages) (in place of Common) 
- Adar gain the [Child of Eluneia](/rules/child_of_eluneia) trait
