Once thought to have been a race dwelling underground—a theory they themselves find insulting—the Naderi are a dark-skinned
folk with pointy ears that somewhat resemble the [Eriothi](/races/eriothi). Naderi are generally arrogant creatures, and
the decadence of their culture was infamous in [Danaros](/locations/danaros). Their [empire](/nations/naderi_empire) spanned
most of a continent, and they had a belief of manifest destiny that led them to war against most of their neighbors time
and time again.

Two events in their history drastically reduced both the population and the power of the Naderi:
- The [Chadori](/races/chadori) uprising
- The [Unbinding](/history/the-unbinding), and subsequent ill-planned evacuation

Today the Naderi are a humbled people who rely more on diplomacy than military force, though many of the older members of
their race still maintain their arrogance.

## Religion

Naderi typically worship [Allindra](/pantheons/the_unscathed).

## Rules

Naderi follow the same rules as **Drow** as stated in the Player's Handbook, page 24, with the following changes:

- Naderi speak [High Imperial](/general/languages) (instead of Elvish) and [Turian](/general/languages) (instead of Common)
- Naderi do not suffer from _Sunlight Sensitivity_
- Naderi gain the [Child of Danaros](/rules/child_of_danaros) trait
