The Chadori are said to descend from dragons, though no definitive proof of this exists anywhere, as for the better part of the past millennium
they have been slaves to the [Naderi Empire](/nations/naderi_empire). This all changed sixty-five years ago, in 1366 [IC](/general/calendar), when a group of slaves
working in a shipyard managed to overpower their guards, steal a ship with a functioning [wakeportal](/items/wakeportal) and travel to [Eluneia](/locations/eluneia), where
they settled on an island they named Liberation.

From there, they made excursions to free more of their people, eventually leading to a full scale rebellion against the
Naderi Empire, that lasted until the outbreak of [the Unbinding](/history/the-unbinding). The Chadori forces retreated to their
islands in Eluneia, taking as many of their kin as they could, while the Naderi struggled to organize their own evacuation, leaving
those Chadori still enslaved in Danaros to die of the Unbinding.

## Religion

Chadori typically worship [Jao Quan](/pantheons/the_unscathed).

## Rules

Chadori follow the same rules as **Dragonborn** as stated in the Player's Handbook, page 32-34, with the following change:

- Chadori speak [Chadori](/general/languages) (instead of Draconic) and [Turian](/general/languages) (instead of Common). Chadori over the age of 75 also speak High Imperial, though they'll generally refuse to do so.
- Chadori gain the [Child of Danaros](/rules/child_of_danaros) trait
