Laktha are pale-skinned humans originally from [Danaros](/locations/danaros), where they had a sizable kingdom with a
large land-based army, but not much of a navy. Their ancestral lands were far removed from the origins of [the Unbinding](/history/the-unbinding),
which gave them ample time to evacuate despite their lack of ships.

The Laktha people can best be described a nihilistic. It is a common belief among the Lakhta that life has no special
 purpose or meaning, and that if an afterlife exists, it will be as meaningless as this life. Lakhta have a tendency to
  shrug off any hardship or misfortune, a trait readily used by their government to stay in power.

Lakhta are highly xenofobic, and view other races, even other humans such as the [Turians](/races/turians) and the [M'to](/races/mto) as inferior. The Lakhta
readily make use of slave labor, though only the [Delvers](/races/delvers) are enslaved by them in great number.

## Religion

Lakhta typically worship [Xax](/pantheons/the_unscathed), though there are also many worshippers of [Belliom](/pantheons/the_unscathed) among them.

## Rules

Lakhta follow the same rules as the **Variant Humans** as stated in the Player's Handbook, page 29 to 31, with the following changes:

- Lakhta speak [Lakhta](/general/languages) (instead of Common) and [Turian](/general/languages), though they generally won't admit the latter
- Lakhta gain the [Child of Danaros](/rules/child_of_danaros) trait
