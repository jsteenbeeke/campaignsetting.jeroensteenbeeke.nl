The Eriothi are a people that were for a long time considered to be myth, as they made their home deep inside the woods of Danaros, and rarely ventured outside. They had
some contact with both the [Companions](/races/companions) and the [Tinkers](/races/tinkers), but tales of their existence from either were at first dismissed as simple stories.

It wasn't until Turian attempts to create a road through one of their forests that they emerged in force, almost resulting in war. Many of the Eriothi perished
due to [the Unbinding](/history/the-unbinding), as they refused to leave their ancient homes.

Through the efforts of the Turian navy, a significant number of them were saved, and are now citizens of the [Coalition of Free Peoples](/nations/coalition_of_free_peoples).

Eriothi are taller than humans, though much slighter of build. They have copperish skin that sometimes shows hints of green, and very
prominent pointy ears.

## Religion

Eriothi typically worship [Riaal](/pantheons/the_unscathed).

## Rules

Eriothi follow the same rules as **Wood Elves** as stated in the Player's Handbook, page 24, with the following changes:

- Eriothi speak [Eriothi](/general/languages) (instead of Elvish) and [Turian](/general/languages) (instead of Common)
- Eriothi gain the [Child of Danaros](/rules/child_of_danaros) trait
