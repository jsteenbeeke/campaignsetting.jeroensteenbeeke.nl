Turians are the most numerous race of humans from [Danaros](/locations/danaros), and come in many shapes and sizes. The fairest
among them are almost as pale as the [Lakhta](/races/lakhta), while some are olive-skinned or even bronze, though not nearly
as dark-skinned as the [M'to](/races/mto).

The Turians had a sizable kingdom on Danaros, rivaled in size only by the [Naderi Empire](/nations/naderi_empire). They were primarily
known for their naval prowess, and the size of their navy enabled them to save a significant portion of not only their
own people, but many of their neighbors from [the Unbinding](/history/the-unbinding), though many of their own people
died due to their close proximity to [Stoneborn](/races/stoneborn) lands.

The Turians used to be an elective monarchy, with nine electors choosing the High King from among their number. But with
the Unbinding killing seven of the electors and their families, as well as the resulting population of their new home on
[Eluneia](/nations/eluneia) being highly heterogenous, this form of government was no longer feasible. The High King abdicated,
and the survivors formed the [Coalition of Free Peoples](/nations/coalition_of_free_peoples).

## Religion

Turians typically worship [Belliom or Riaal](/pantheons/the_unscathed).

## Rules

Turians follow the same rules as the **Variant Humans** as stated in the Player's Handbook, page 29 to 31, with the following changes:

- Turians speak [Turian](/general/languages) (instead of Common), and one language of their choice.
- Turians gain the [Child of Danaros](/rules/child_of_danaros) trait
