## Rules

Turians follow the same rules as the **Variant Humans** as stated in the Player's Handbook, page 29 to 31, with the following changes:

- Turians speak [Turian](/general/languages) (instead of Common), and one language of their choice.
- Turians gain the [Child of Danaros](/rules/child_of_danaros) trait
