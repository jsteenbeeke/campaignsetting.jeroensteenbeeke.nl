In comparison to other humans, the M'to stand out. They are dark-skinned, and live in tribal societies that are considered
primitive by most other civilizations. Despite this reputation, however, the M'to are skilled craftsmen, and expert builders
when it comes to anything made of wood.

The M'to people are not united in the same sense that other races are, instead forming a loose collection of tribes that 
meet on every full moon to discuss the future of their peoples. Outside of this, it is not rare to find the M'to fighting
among themselves, though this practice has lessened since the formation of the [Northborn Alliance](/nations/northborn_alliance).

## Religion

M'to typically worship [Ord, Dealas or Saigra](/pantheons/watchers).

## Rules

M'to follow the same rules as the **Humans** as stated in the Player's Handbook, page 29 to 31, with the following changes:

- M'to speak [M'to](/general/languages), one language of their choice, and one of the following:
  - [Dvergi](/general/languages)
  - [Griash](/general/languages)
  - [Kalai](/general/languages)
- M'to gain the [Child of Eluneia](/rules/child_of_eluneia) trait
