Danaros is the world that is home to many of the races that now roam the seas of [Eluneia](/locations/eluneia). It
is a world that was once not unlike Earth, with one vast continent and a multitude of islands.

Fifty-five years ago, it was struck by something that is now known as the [Unbinding](/history/the-unbinding), which
devastated all life and made the entire world uninhabitable. The survivors managed to flee to Eluneia.
