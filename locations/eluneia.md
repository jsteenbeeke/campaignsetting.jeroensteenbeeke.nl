Eluneia is the world where this campaign takes place. Formerly a world similar to Earth, a [collision of
multiversal proportions](/history/great-cataclysm) caused an unstable portal to the Elemental Plane of Water
to form, turning the world into an ocean world with many islands.

After the [Unbinding](/history/the-unbinding) happened on [Danaros](/locations/danaros), those that had the means
used planar travel to flee to Eluneia.
