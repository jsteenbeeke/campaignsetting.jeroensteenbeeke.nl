The **Undercity** is part of the city of [Consensus](/locations/consensus), and is located underneath its harbor. The Undercity
is home to a number of aquatic species. 

Among surface-dwelling species it has the reputation of lawlessness, mostly due to the
fact that the guards of Consensus, who are mostly [Turian](/races/turians), don't have the means to breathe underwater, and therefore
cannot enforce laws there. In truth, the [Third Wave](/nations/third_wave) and [Tower Guardians](/nations/tower_guardians)
do enforce laws there, but there are several criminal organizations that make their home in the Undercity.
