The Tower of Atan is a gigantic structure on [Tower Island](/locations/tower_island) that is known primarily as the location
of the [Eye of Atan](/items/eye_of_atan). Its exact date of construction is unknown, though the [Sethai](/nations/sethai_federation) claim
the Eye of Atan did not become visible until after the [Great Cataclysm](/history/great-cataclysm)

A single [Tower Guardian](/nations/tower_guardians) stands guard at the tower, though it is said the tower has other defences.
An attempt by the [Lakhta Hegemony](/nations/lakhta_hegemony) to gain control of the tower failed spectacularly, with their
entire force obliterated, and the Tower Guardians subsequently tearing down their embassy.
