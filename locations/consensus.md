Consensus is home to people of all races, and as such is one of the most vibrant cities on [Eluneia](/locations/eluneia). It was founded
shortly after [the Unbinding](/history/the-unbinding) as a gathering place for the various nations, to enable peaceful
resolution
of conflicts.

Due to its central nation and proximity to the Eye of Atan, the vast majority of the inhabitants have little to do with
the diplomats who also call the city home.
