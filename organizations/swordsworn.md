To the Swordsworn, nothing matters more than fighting, and to defeat ever greater foes. The Swordsworn are a society
that has their origins among the [M'to](/races/mto) and [Warbloods](/races/warbloods), though members of any race are
welcome provided they follow their beliefs.

The Swordsworn constantly seek to improve themselves and others in the art of combat, and as such, often travel the world
in search of either greater challenges, or greater teachers.

## Beliefs

1. The urge to fight is natural to all species, and should not be supressed
2. Only through pain and hardship can one truly grow
3. It is not enough to fight, one must become the best fighter one can possibly be, and help others of our order to do the same

## Goals

To become the greatest fighters in the multiverse.
