The [Great Cataclyms](/history/great-cataclysm) resulted in the loss of hundreds of libraries and written records, destroying
much of the history of [Eluneia](/history/eluneia) prior to its flooding. The Gwydian Society was formed to prevent such
a loss of knowledge from ever occurring again.

Despite being named after [Gwydion, the Watcher god of Prophecy](/pantheons/watchers), the society is secular, and focuses
on the gathering and preservation of all knowledge. The society maintains great libraries throughout [Eluneia](/locations/eluneia),
and is even said to have backup libraries in the [Everwoods](/general/cosmology), the [Waterdark](/general/cosmology) and [Perpetuum](/general/cosmology).

## Beliefs

1. We should never allow knowledge to become lost again
2. Redundancy is key, all knowledge should be stored in more than one place
3. No knowledge is beyond saving

## Goals

To ensure the preservation of all knowledge for all eternity
