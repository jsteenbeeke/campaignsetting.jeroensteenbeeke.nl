Though many believe their existence to be a myth, the mysterious group known as the Seekers can be found in many places
throughout [Eluneia](/locations/eluneia). Historically their members were exclusively [Sethai](/races/sethai), though
in recent years a number of [Turians](/races/turians), [Eriothi](/races/eriothi) and [Chadori](/races/chadori) have joined
their number.

The Seekers generally do not linger in one place, and are generally vague about their intentions, though their goals are
almost always benevolent. When pressed, they will tell that a great evil will one day reawaken, and that they are preparing
for the war that will follow.

## Beliefs

1. Somewhere in this world a great evil slumbers, and only united can we face this evil
2. We cannot face our enemy alone
3. Our enemy will go to any length to achieve victory. We cannot allow ourselves to do the same, or our victory will be meaningless

## Goals

To ensure the world remains free of the great evil, while maintaining the integrity of those who fight them.
