The Consensus Council is an assembly with representatives of the various nations
inhabiting [Eluneia](/locations/eluneia), and
primarily concerns trade negotations. In rare cases, it acts as a mediator in case of conflicts between member nations.
It was founded
shortly after the mass migration of refugees from [Danaros](/locations/danaros) following
the [Unbinding](/history/the-unbinding).

The Council is named after the city of [Consensus](/locations/consensus), where they meet on a weekly basis.

The Consensus Council consists of representatives from the following nations:

* [Chadori Republic](/nations/chadori_republic)
* [Coalition of Free Peoples](/nations/coalition_of_free_peoples)
* [Naderi Empire](/nations/naderi_empire)
* [Northborn Alliance](/nations/northborn_alliance)
* [Sethai Federation](/nations/sethai_federation)
* [The Third Wave](/nations/third_wave)
* [Tower Guardians](/nations/tower-guardians)

The isolationist [Adar Kingdom](/nations/adar_kingdom) declined membership, though are on friendly
terms with the [Sethai Federation](/nations/sethai_federation) and
the [Coalition of Free Peoples](/nations/coalition_of_free_peoples).
The militaristic [Lakhta Hegemony](/nations/lakhta_hegemony) are former members, whose presence
on [Tower Island](/locations/tower_island) is no longer tolerated by
the [Tower Guardians](/nations/tower_guardians) after a failed attempt of conquest.
