The Consensus Council is an assembly with representatives of the various nations inhabiting [Eluneia](/locations/eluneia), and
primarily concerns trade negotations. In rare cases, it acts as a mediator in case of conflicts between member nations. It was founded
shortly after the mass migration of refugees from [Danaros](/locations/danaros) following the [Unbinding](/history/the-unbinding).

The Council is named after the city of [Consensus](/locations/consensus), where they meet on a weekly basis.

The Consensus Council consists of representatives from the following nations:

* [Chadori Republic](/nations/chadori_republic)

* [Northborn Alliance](/nations/northborn_alliance)
* [Sethai Federation](/nations/sethai_federation)
