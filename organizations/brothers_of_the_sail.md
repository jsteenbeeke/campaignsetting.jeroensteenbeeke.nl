Considered by the authorities of the various nations to be nothing more than pirates, the Brothers of the Sail are an
anarchist organization seeking the abolishment of any form of government and the return to self-sufficiency. While some
small groups of Brothers live in the inner islands, their larger communities exist well beyond the lands of the various
nations that form the [Consensus Council](/organizations/consensus_council).

But not all brothers live in communities such as this. Many of them are employed within the various nations, often as
sailors or adventurers. Through their work, they seek to encourage people to rise up against their governments.
